# CS6350-FinalProject-Public
The public version that excludes most stories that are not currently publicly available or have been altered heavily.

REQUIRED:

- Python 3.9 (tested up to 3.9.13 - 3.9.15)

- pyvis (pip install pyvis)
- networkx (pip install networkx)
- Scikit-Learn (pip install -U scikit-learn)

In order to test, please uncomment one set of stories/gold in main.py. Sorry, trying to make the thing from scratch and didn't have time to take care of a smarter method!

python src/main.py

or

bash run.sh

If there are any issues, please let me know through Canvas and I will get back to you ASAP!
